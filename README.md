## Getting Started

### Firebase Setup

2. Go to your <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
3. Create a new project. <a href="https://www.firebasemaster.com/setup/how-to-create-firebase-project">[guide]</a>
4. Register your app <a href="https://www.firebasemaster.com/setup/how-add-web-app-to-firebase-project">[guide]</a>

### Local Development
Follow these steps to set up the project for local development:

1. After completing the Firebase setup, clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nc1z/react-pwa-starter
    cd react-pwa-starter/
    ```
2. Create a `.env` file and copy the Firebase SDK code from Firebase into the respective environment variables. You can refer to the `.env.example` file.
3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Deployment
To deploy your application to a staging environment and access it on your mobile device, follow these steps.

Make sure you have <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli">Firebase CLI</a> installed

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

If you haven't already, log in to Firebase and initialize it in your repository.

For a step-by-step deployment guide, check out this <a href="https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/web-development/deploying-react-app-to-firebase">article</a>

Once initialization is completed, you can use the following scripts for deployment:

### `deploy:dev`
Deploys to the Firebase `development` environment for preview.

### `deploy:prod`
Deploys to the Firebase `live` production environment.

### `deploy:list`
Shows a list of running environments.

## Building New Pages

When creating new pages, you'll find the components in the `src/views` folder. These components serve as the main content body.

The parent container uses a class called `PageContainer`, which enables overscroll, touch action, and overflow.

Take a look at the `src/views/Home` component for reference. For style customizations, check out `src/App.css`.
